# **snake-game**
Made a Snake Game using Python (Turtle Module) 

# **How to Run**
1.  Open the project day20 in a local code editor such as pycharm.
2.  Run the main.py file
3.  The game starts ASA you run the file , So lock your fingers in the arrow keys.

**Alternatively** you can go to the project directory and enter the command "main.py"

**How to Play**
--> No need to explain the controls right?.. Just use Up,Down,Left,Right Arrows Key to Play, All the best .
--> The Snake Should Not hit the wall/ or bite itself.
